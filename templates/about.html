        <h2 class = "h2">Why Kernle?</h2>
        <h3 class = "h3">Problem</h3>
        <p>
            There is a ton of information on the internet. However, a lot of that information requires significant background knowledge and time to sift through. The wikipedia page on quantum physics is very complicated and hard to understand.
        </p>
        <h3 class = "h3">Kernle's Solution</h3>
        <p>
            This is where Kernle comes in. Kernle provides the central/most important part (kernel) of a concept. Understanding the central/most important part of a concept makes it much easier to then use the internet's vast knowledge to explore the details of the concept.
        </p>
        <h2 class = "h2">Use Cases</h2>
